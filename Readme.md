# Vehicle Detection Project

This project is a vehicle detection system built using Flask, React, and YOLOv3 model. The main purpose of this project is to detect vehicles in images or videos and provide real-time insights. It combines the power of deep learning with web technologies to offer a seamless user experience for vehicle detection tasks.

## Features

- **Vehicle Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model for accurate and efficient vehicle detection in images or videos.
- **Real-time Detection:** Provides real-time detection capabilities, making it suitable for applications such as traffic monitoring, parking management, and security systems.
- **Web Interface:** Offers a user-friendly web interface built with React for easy interaction and visualization of the detection results.
- **Customizable:** The project structure allows for easy customization and extension to suit specific requirements and use cases.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - CSS3: Styling the user interface.
  
- **Backend:**
  - Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
  
- **Deep Learning:**
  - YOLOv3: A state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm for detecting vehicles.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the frontend development server.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `python app.py`

Starts the Flask backend server.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to interact with the backend.
